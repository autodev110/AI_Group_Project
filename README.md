Artificial Intelligence                                    Fall 2025
(Group Project)
Due date: 12/09/2025

For your group project, you are requested to do a complete process of optimization.

The project is as follows:
1: You are to execute a given optimization approach on the data of your choice. You are all assigned an article related to optimization. You can choose one of those methods among your group mates (a group will have three articles and three methods to choose from based on your individually assigned article). You need to get the data (open-source data or the benchmark data that are shared or used in your assigned article). They do not need to be large. If they are large, you can choose a small subsample for your experiment.

2: You will need to prepare a short project description (no more than 8 pages) explaining what you did in every step in detail and present your results, analysis, and discussion (no more than 8 pages including plots, tables, and discussion). Please cite those papers/articles that you use in your project description. You will also send your code with proper commenting, along with your report, to me via email.
Note: You need to do step 2 in the Python programming language.
